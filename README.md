# Phishing Awareness Simulation Lab with GoPhish

## Objective

In this project, I built a phishing simulation lab to understand how phishing attacks work and how to defend against them. I used a tool called GoPhish in a safe, virtual environment to create and manage fake phishing emails. This hands-on setup helped me learn how attackers design phishing campaigns and steps organizations can illustrate during trainings to improve security awareness.

### Skills Learned

- Install and configure GoPhish on Ubuntu
- How phishing emails are created using custom templates
- Basics of social engineering and how phishing tricks users
- Create a safe environment to run security tests.
- Build a phishing landing pages to simulate real attacks
- Run a phishing campaign and monitor user responses
- How to analyze the results to understand user behavior

### Tools Used
- GoPhish – An open-source tool for creating phishing simulations
- Ubuntu Linux – Used as the operating system to run GoPhish
- VirtualBox – To set up and manage a virtual machine for safe testing
- Web Browser – To interact with GoPhish interface
